      - 6.5 You acknowledge that the transmission of unencrypted (or

8.  ## Your rights
    
      - 8.1 In this Section 9, we have summarised the rights that you
        have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex,
        and not all of the details have been included in our summaries.
        Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from
        the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these
        rights.
        
          
    
      - 8.2 Your principal rights under data protection law are:
        
          - (a) the right to access;
        
          - (b) the right to rectification;
        
          - (c) the right to erasure;
        
          - (d) the right to restrict processing;
        
          - (e) the right to object to processing;
        
          - (f) the right to data portability;
        
          - (g) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
        
          - (h) the right to withdraw consent.
    
      - 8.3 You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we
        process your personal data and, where we do, access to the
        personal data, together with certain additional information.
        That additional information includes details of the purposes of
        the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and
        the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and
        freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a
        copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free
        of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable
        fee. You can access your personal data by visiting https://
        app.getradar.io/a/account when logged into the website.
        
          
    
      - 8.4 You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data
        about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the
        processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you
        completed.
        
          
    
      - 8.5 In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of
        your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances
        include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation
        to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise
        processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; the
        processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal
        data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are certain
        general exclusions of the right to erasure. Those general
        exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising
        the right of freedom of expression and information; for
        
        compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment,
        exercise or defence of legal claims.
        
          
    
      - 8.6 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the
        processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you
        contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is
        unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal
        data for the purposes of our processing, but you require
        personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of
        legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the
        verification of that objection. Where processing has been
        restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal
        data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your
        consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
        claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or
        legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
        
          
    
      - 8.7 You have the right to object to our processing of your
        personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation,
        but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing
        is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a
        task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
        any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the
        legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you
        make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal
        information unless we can demonstrate
        compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override
        your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for
        the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
        
          
    
      - 8.8 You have the right to object to our processing of your
        personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling
        for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection,
        we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.
        
          
    
      - 8.9 You have the right to object to our processing of your
        personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or
        statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular
        situation, unless the processing is necessary for the
        performance of a task carried out for reasons of public
        interest.
        
          
    
      - 8.10 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of
        your personal data is consent, and such processing is carried
        out by automated means, you have the right to receive your
        personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and
        machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply
        where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of
        others.
        
          
    
      - 8.11 If you consider that our processing of your personal
        information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal
        right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
        responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member
        state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the
        place of the alleged infringement.
        
          
    
      - 8.12 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of
        your personal information is consent, you have the right to
        withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect
        the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
        
          
    
      - 8.13 You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your
        personal data by written notice to us.
    
      - 8.14 You may instruct us to provide you with any personal
        information we hold about you; provision of such information
        will be subject to: (a) the supply of appropriate evidence of
        your identity (for this purpose, we will usually accept a
        photocopy of your passport certified by a solicitor or bank plus
        an original copy of a utility bill showing your current
        address).
